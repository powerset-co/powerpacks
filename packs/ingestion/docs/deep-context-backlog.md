# Deep Context backlog

Created: 2026-08-06

Change log:
- 2026-08-06: initial deferred-work inventory after the SQLite rewrite.

These items are deliberately outside the mechanical D2 cleanup round. They are
not implicit acceptance criteria for that round.

## Deferred items

- Perf: worth CTE as a real `CREATE VIEW`; `eligible_links AS MATERIALIZED`;
  single-row `review_row(db, key)` for the adapter's per-click lookup;
  settlement `links_by_key`; `clear_machine_winner_conflicts` as bulk SQL;
  `workflow_state` currently re-evaluates `WORTH_CTE` 6× per poll.
- Readability polish: `identity_scope` double-negatives → named CTEs;
  `effective_decision` refactor (compute one chosen decision, derive);
  `person_lookup`'s 13 positional params → named SQL params;
  `contact_identifiers` split; cross-module private imports cleanup.
- Parent→children helper: one shared `children_by_parent` home (hand-rolled in
  ~10 sites); `_approved_identities` as one SQL query.
- `owner.json` read-back inversion (file is the record, SQLite the mirror —
  should invert).
- `ReviewExportRow` collapse into a typed decision row (post-batons-deletion).
- Synthetic rows have no delete path when a parent's worth later leaves
  `yes`.
- `.enrich-progress.is-indeterminate` has CSS but no emitter (baseline had an
  agent-handoff indeterminate bar).
- Pyright/mypy in the lint gate (sizing unknown; conventions already require
  annotations).
- `merge_verdicts` stale-row accumulation (unbounded paid-cache growth).
- Guided free-text box auto-applying any pasted LinkedIn URL as a decision —
  review UX question.
- BIG one, own project: network-import speaks SQLite — `people.csv` becomes a
  derived export; Deep Context stage 1 collapses to a join.
- Stage-2 message-entry typing (`MessageEntry` dataclass at the channel
  readers) — REQUIRES a byte-identical bundle-JSON serialization pin
  (`input_evidence_fingerprint` is a paid cache key).

## Owner audit findings (2026-08-07)

Logged during Arthur's read-through; not yet fixed.

### One db door, not two (with a real silent-create hole)

11 stage classes take BOTH `db: Db | None = None` and `db_path: Path = CANONICAL_DB`,
reconcile them (`self.db_path = db.db_path if db is not None else Path(db_path)`),
and then fall back to `Db(self.db_path)` at execute time — which CREATES an empty
database rather than refusing. `open_existing_db()` protection currently lives only
in the 14 CLI `main()` functions, so any in-process construction still silently
creates an empty store and reports "0 rows, completed".

Fix: stage classes take `db: Db` (required); `main()` is the only place a path
becomes a Db, via `open_existing_db`. Delete the `db_path` parameter and the
reconciliation line. Only `check_readiness` (must report on a possibly-absent DB)
and `migrate_sqlite` (the sanctioned creator) stay path-based.

Affected: build_owner, check_readiness*, collect_person_context, compose_dossier,
lookup_person, parallel_research/models, persist_review_identities,
prefetch_profiles, profile_projection, review_web/server, validate_dossiers.
Only 4 mains pass `db_path=` today (build_owner, check_readiness, collect, lookup).

### Stage 1 has no entry point, and its trigger has a hidden mode

`project_imported_people` is called from exactly one place: the first lines of
`CollectPersonContext.execute()`. So the spec lists nine stages while the code
ships eight commands — "ensure-parents" is a step inside collect, which reads as
a duplicate projection to anyone following the spec.

Second-order: the call sits behind `if self.people_csv is not None`, but the CLI
argument defaults to `DEFAULT_PEOPLE_CSV` and `main()` always passes it. Via the
CLI the projection ALWAYS runs; the `None` branch is reachable only by direct
construction (tests), i.e. a skip-stage-1 mode that nothing ships.

Resolve one of two ways:
- Code matches spec: stage 1 becomes its own node/command; collect reads what is
  already projected.
- Spec matches code: document stage 1 as "runs at collect entry, not a separate
  command", and drop the Optional so `people_csv` always projects (one behavior,
  no hidden mode).

### ContextSources is assembled from outside (half-done construct-and-run)

`CollectPersonContext.execute()` reaches into the ContextSources instance and
drives it: `store = self.sources.store`, `self.sources.accounts.clear()`,
`self.sources.gmail_available = False`, then `store.connect()`,
`store.require_schema()`, `self.sources.accounts.update(store.account_emails())`,
`self.sources.gmail_available = True`. It also probes chat.db readability and
prints the Full Disk Access warning itself.

So D2 moved the reading methods into the class but left the wiring in the caller.
Consequence, same class as the people_csv hidden mode: `gmail_available` starts
False and is set only by that one caller, so a ContextSources constructed
anywhere else silently reads ZERO Gmail and reports success.

Fix: ContextSources owns its own readiness — open the store, validate schema,
discover accounts, set availability, probe chat.db — in one method returning a
typed readiness result the driver merely reports. No `sources.store`
reach-through, no external field assignment. Source-availability warnings belong
to the source object, not the stage driver.

### The resume/skip decision has no tests

`collection/state.py: bundle_matches_policy` is the sole gate deciding whether an
existing raw bundle is reused or re-collected (called once, from
`collect_person_context.py` inside the per-person loop). It compares seven things:
policy presence, deep_cap, include_groups, max_group_size, emails, phones,
source_channels. Nothing in tests/ references it.

Failure directions are asymmetric: too strict merely re-collects (slow, visible);
too permissive silently reuses a stale bundle — and because the bundle content is
then unchanged, the synthesis input fingerprint is unchanged too, so the staleness
never surfaces downstream. Worth one test per condition (each field differing →
re-collect; all matching → skip), since this is the only thing standing between an
evidence change and a silently stale dossier.

### Source channels are untyped, and their constant set is rebuilt per call

`collection/state.py: source_parents` builds `message_channels =
{GMAIL_CHANNEL, IMESSAGE_CHANNEL, WHATSAPP_CHANNEL}` inside the function on every
call. It is a constant: hoist to a module-level `MESSAGE_CHANNELS` in caps, named
for its intent (the people we can actually read messages for). It is NOT redundant
— on the owner's real install the source values are gmail_msgvault 519, imessage
102, linkedin_csv 88, whatsapp 26, so this set is what excludes the 88
LinkedIn-only people from collection.

Underlying inconsistency: GMAIL_CHANNEL / IMESSAGE_CHANNEL / WHATSAPP_CHANNEL are
loose string constants in common.py while every sibling concept (RowKind,
IdentifierKind, ArtifactKind) is a StrEnum in db/models.py. Make a SourceChannel
StrEnum and derive MESSAGE_CHANNELS from it.

Also in the same function: `sources: dict[str, list[str]]` and `identifiers:
dict[str, dict[str, list[str]]]` are annotated but meaningless — nothing says
person_id -> identifier_kind -> values. With SourceChannel/IdentifierKind as key
types this reads itself. And the function as a whole is a hand-rolled GROUP BY
over a full snapshot (group sources by person, identifiers by person and kind,
join people, drop owners, regroup by parent) — the same shape flagged in ~10 other
sites; a SQL query or one shared grouping helper replaces it.
